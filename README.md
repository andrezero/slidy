# Slidy is a minimal carousel POC

> A simple exercise to help me understand what is the developer experience creating a small JS/CSS library in 2021. tl;dr: it's quite nice.

## WARNING(s)

1. This code is not maintained.
1. This code is not actively maintained.
1. Need an actual carousel? try [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).
1. This code does not play well with frameworks such as React. Try [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) isntead.

## How to use

Install via npm.

```
npm install @andrezero/slidy
```

Add some slides inside a container.

```html
<div id="my-slider">
  <div>Slide 1</div>
  <div>Slide 2</div>
  <div>Slide 3</div>
</div>
```

Create an instance

```javascript
import Slidy from '@andrezero/slidy';

const container = document.getElementById('my-slider');
const slidy1 = Slidy.create(container);
```

Restore original DOM and remove event listeners when you are done.

```javascript
slidy1.destroy();
```

You can also dispose of all instances at once.

```javascript
Slidy.destroy();
```

### Via CDN

Alternatively you can load Slidy into a web page directly.

```html
<!-- goes before </head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//cdn.../slidy.css" />

<!-- goes before </body> -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.../slidy.js"></script>
```

## API

### Slidy.create(container[, options]): Slidy instance

- **container** dom element that contains the slides
- **options** object with configuration options

| option  | type    | default | description                |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| buttons | boolean | true    | show previous/next buttons |
| dots    | boolean | false   | show navigation dots       |

### Slidy.destroy(container[, options]): Slidy instance

## TODO

- API auto()
- API destroy()
- accessibility
- disable buttons at the end of the track
- options: enable swipe
- options: enable dots
- options: disable arraoes
- gaps
- keyboard navigation

## Limitations

The size of the slider is always the container's size (width and height). In other words, you are in total control of the slider's dimensions and it will be as responsive as your container.

On the other hand, changing the content or style of a slide, in ways that affect its width, will cause gaps or overlaps between slides.

As a rule of thumb:

- slides should not have fixed widths
- the heighest slide dictates the height of the slider.
