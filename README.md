# Slidy is a minimal carousel POC

> A simple exercise to help me evaluate the DX of creating a small JS+CSS library using webpack and friends. **tl;dr:** it's quite nice.

See it in action: [demo/docs](https://andrezero.github.io/slidy/).

## WARNING(s)

1. This code is not actively maintained.
1. This is a POC, not a boilerplate.
1. This is a POC, not an actual library you would want to use.
1. Need an actual carousel? try [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).
1. This code does not play well with frameworks such as React. Try [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) isntead.

## How to use

Install via npm.

```
npm install @andrezero/slidy
```

Add some slides inside a container.

```html
<div id="my-slider">
  <div>Slide 1</div>
  <div>Slide 2</div>
  <div>Slide 3</div>
</div>
```

Create an instance

```javascript
import Slidy from '@andrezero/slidy';

const container = document.getElementById('my-slider');
const slidy1 = Slidy.create(container);
```

Restore original DOM and remove event listeners when you are done.

```javascript
slidy1.destroy();
```

You can also dispose of all instances at once.

```javascript
Slidy.destroy();
```

### Via CDN

Alternatively you can load **Slidy** into a web page directly.

```html
<!-- goes before </head> -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://statics.andretorgal.com/exp/slidy/slidy.css"
/>

<!-- goes before </body> -->
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://statics.andretorgal.com/exp/slidy/slidy.js"
></script>
```

And immediately use the global variable. Old school.

```javascript
Slidy.create();
```

## API

### Slidy.create(container[, options])

Attach Slidy to a container element.

**Return value:** Carousel instance.

**Params:**

- **container**: dom element that contains the slides
- **options**: object with configuration options

| option  | type    | default | description                |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| buttons | boolean | true    | show previous/next buttons |
| dots    | boolean | false   | show navigation dots       |

### Slidy.destroy()

Destroy all instances, restoring original DOM and removing all event listeners.

### slidy.destroy()

Destroy a carousel instance, restoring original DOM and removing all event listeners.

## TODO

- testing mocha
- testing cypress
- API slidy.onSlide((index: number) => void)
- API slidy.addSlides(nodes: node[])
- API slidy.removeSlide(index: number)
- API Slidy.destroy()
- disable buttons at the end of the track
- accessibility
- options: enable dots
- options: disable arraows
- options: enable swipe
- gaps
- keyboard navigation

## Limitations

The size of the slider is always the container's size (width and height). In other words, you are in total control of the slider's dimensions and it will be as responsive as your container.

On the other hand, changing the content or style of a slide, in ways that affect its width, will cause gaps or overlaps between slides.

As a rule of thumb:

- slides should not have fixed widths
- the heighest slide dictates the height of the slider.

## Developing

**Under the hood:**

- dependencies:
  - none
- webpack
  - babel-loader
  - css-loader + mini-css-extract-plugin
  - svg-inline-loader
  - terser-webpack-plugin
  - html-webpack-plugin (for the docs page)
- babel
  - browserslist
  - preset-env
  - plugin-proposal-class-properties
- linting
  - prettier
  - eslint + @babel/eslint-parser + eslint-standard + eslint-prettier

### Scripts

- `npm run start` - runs webpack + server (dev config)
- `npm run dev` - runs webpack + tests in watch mode (dev config)
- `npm run docs` - runs http-server docs
- `npm run build` - runs webpack (production config)
